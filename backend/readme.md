This compilation captures those spontaneous and seemingly purposeless actions that cross our minds in a split second. Here are a few instances:

1. The irresistible tendency to unconsciously pick leaves or break a branch upon encountering one.

2. The artful act of pretending to be asleep when someone unexpectedly walks into the room.

3. The curious habit of counting each step while ascending or descending stairs.
